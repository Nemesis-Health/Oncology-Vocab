# Analysis of Vocabulary Updates

Table 1 summarizes how concepts within various vocabularies have changed their standardness status when comparing newly refreshed oncology vocabularies to a baseline version.

|Vocabulary ID|Old Standard Concept|New Standard Concept|Count|
|---|---|---|---|
|HCPCS|Standard|Non-standard with mapping|4|
|ICDO3|Standard|Non-standard with mapping|1|
|LOINC|Standard|Non-standard with mapping|82|
|NAACCR|Standard|Non-standard with mapping|141|
|SNOMED|Standard|Non-standard with mapping|62|
